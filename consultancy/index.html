<p>Really elegant way of focusing team efforts around content marketing initiatives. Not having <em>a clear idea</em> is about not exploring the problem methodically enough which is always a great place to start:-)</p>

    </h3>
    <div class="asset-content">
        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I&#8217;ve been working with some developers recently and decided to evaluate a website production workflow built around <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll website">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator (I&#8217;ve been interested in these for a while, not least because this site is generated and hosted using Movable Type, the daddy of static site generators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&#8217;re launching our new website before it&#8217;s ready.
But Dug, there are bits that don&#8217;t work; there are pages missing and also some weird copy?!? What&#8217;s up with that?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well yes, you&#8217;re right, there are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>The rough edges will evaporate over the next few weeks as our teams rapidly iterate from our first minimum viable product (MVP) release through our subsequent rapid iterations.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t random, it&#8217;s a choice we&#8217;ve made. How often do you have the chance to rethink your website and in the process run a live-ammunition test of the principles you&#8217;ve been suggesting your customers live by? Well, not everyday but this time we&#8217;re grabbing the opportunity and jumping in at the deep end.</p>

<p>We want to practise what we preach, eat our dog-food and keep our possibilities as real as we can.</p>

<h2>So what has this meant in detail?</h2>

<p>Well, as is fitting for cross-silo digital thinking, the decisions we made to organise the design and production teams and the decisions we made about application architecture and design were all intertwined and taken by a connected group of experts. We decided we didn&#8217;t want to break just the traditional technology/design silo but also the geography one as well. For this project we wanted round-the-clock connectivity between our associates working in remote locations and our two studio-based teams in Edinburgh and London.</p>

<p>We decided to go for it and experiment with technology.</p>

<h2>Collaborating in the digital workplace</h2>

<p>For this project we are collaborating using a network of services that connect each designer&#8217;s laptop to a distributed version control system. The copywriting and development environment is compiled on each machine and connects to the central hub. We are using an always-on Slack channel to ensure feedback is rapid and everyone stays up-to-date with project developments. We are experimenting with using Github as the digital asset manager (DAM) to handle both graphics, content and code version control. Documentation and training on the new platform is also being handled using Slack.</p>

<ul>
<li>Team collaboration around assets and content was managed on Github which allowed painless version control</li>
<li>Code was managed on Github with seamless localhost working using the Ruby environment and Foreman </li>
<li>Deployment happens automatically so communication between design and development teams focused more on creativity and quality and less on support and action requests</li>
<li>Designers in all locations shared the same spec of local build so connectivity was not required at all times to continue working</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we feel is going well</h2>

<ul>
<li>The teams have successfully adopted new tools</li>
<li>Great use of Slack allowed consistent chatter, design reviews and easy debugging</li>
<li>Great use of GitHub allowed collaborative development, issue tracking and version control</li>
<li>Rapid development, deployment, feedback, iteration loop</li>
<li>Jekyll and templating</li>
<li>Local development environment was reproducible with very few hiccups</li>
<li>The team managed to ship the mvp release on time</li>
</ul>

<h2>Continuous deployment</h2>

<p>We defined our MVP as delivering one clear message and it does.</p>

<p>Also, from kick-off to DNS migration took 10 days, not bad for a corporate website. Even better when you consider release 1.5 is due in a few days and r2 will ship shortly after that. With every release we&#8217;ll improve the quality and clarity of the copy; make the imagery stronger and better positioned, fix bugs and add missing content.</p>

<!--

We're experimenting in real-time with a static site generator (what's a static site generator you ask? https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) built into a continuous deployment environment. Our dev team has set this environment up:

* Code created and managed on Github
* Service hosted on Github pages
* Foreman used to run localhost environment versions
* Sass for CSS componentisation
* Markdown used as text interpreter
* Static site build using Jekyll with automatic rebuild on edit commit
* Page environment variables stored in Yaml front matter
* Templating logic coded in Liquid
* The environment is configured so that when edits are committed to the production branch, the build is triggered automatically and the live website is updated. The system isn't perfect yet, but the speed and performance implications of static pages combined with the benefits of continual deployment make this a potentially disruptive platform approach.

To quote from wikipedia continual deployment brings numerous benefits to customers:

Accelerated time to market: continuous deployment lets an organisation deliver the business value inherent in new software releases to customers more quickly 
Building the right product: frequent releases let the application development teams obtain user feedback more quickly
Improved productivity and efficiency: significant time savings for developers, testers, operations engineers, etc. through automation
Reliable releases: the risks associated with a release have significantly decreased, and the release process has become more reliable
Improved product quality: the number of open bugs and production incidents has decreased significantly
Improved customer satisfaction

-->

<p>To be clear, we&#8217;ve not lost our marbles.</p>

<p>We understand our customers need lovely reliable tools like Sitecore and AEM to drive their experiences but these agile and lean approaches are an area of digital technology that is quickly evolving and becoming ever more flexible and efficient. We want to make sure we live the experiences we ask our customers to live. We want to help customers benefit from our knowledge and experience in these new approaches.</p>

<p>To be honest, it&#8217;s a little scary working in public this way but you just can&#8217;t buy the energising effect it has on our team and we want to share that energy with our customers.</p>

<p>Onwards to the next iteration:-)</p>

        <a href="/accountability-v-engagement.html">Being a better agency (accountability and engagement)</a>
    </h3>
    <div class="asset-content">
        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>So a friend of mine recently gave me <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Be-Wrong-Mathematical/dp/0143127535" title="The book on Amazon">a book on mathematics</a> which has got me thinking about stuff in new ways. Early on in the book the author introduces the impact of linear relationships on how we reach conclusions about the rights and wrongs of situations.</p>

<p><a href="/i/acc-eng.png"><img alt="Accountability and engagement in non-linear relationship" src="/assets_c/2015/11/acc-eng-thumb-580xauto-1683.png" width="580" height="312"  style="" /></a></p>

<p>So here&#8217;s a thought: Agencies increasingly understand that accountability is important in winning and retaining customers. Linear reasoning would say that if a little accountability produced good results, then more accountability would produce even better results. This is the &#8220;more is better&#8221; way of thinking.</p>

<p>Now what happens if you map employee engagement to agency accountability? Imagine a studio at the early stages of a relationship. Leadership is trying to introduce new processes and ways of working that are going to increase customer satisfaction and help grow the business. Everyone is involved, working and learning together and trying to do a good job. My guess is this would help grow enagement.</p>

<p>The question I had was would employee engagement and agency accountability map in a linear way? If the effort and team-work to start increasing accountability brings about a positive-feeling leading to greater designer engagement then would further accountability initiatives lead to even greater engagement?</p>

<p>My guess is the reality is closer to the curve plotted in the chart above. At a certain point, the extra effort, speed and transparency would begin to grate. As designers, we would begin to feel like the magic and specialness of what we do was being pushed to the side. Eventually, as the environment became more strict, life would begin to feel like a sausage machine. Not what we signed-up for.</p>

<p>But this is just a thought, I could be wrong:-) </p>

<p>Have you experienced a strong design culture that survived growth challenges like this?</p>

    </h3>
    <div class="asset-content">
        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Well... good question:-)</p>

<p>I think it might be worth pulling the problem apart a little bit. What do we mean by wearables?</p>

<p>If I could chip my 13-year-old daughter I possibly would. This would make her body part of the cloud and the chip a sort of wearable.</p>

<p>Same thing applies to other devices that are either permanently online or can trigger a beacon. I backed Tile and bought a card https://www.thetileapp.com and it's pretty cool. I've got a few attached to things I carry around in my laptop bag.</p>

<p><img alt="Tileapp" src="/i/tileapp.jpg" width="580" height="357"  style="" /></p>

<p>Does that make my presentation clicker a wearable? I guess not but you can see how these things fit into a wider ecosystem of connected stuff related to a given human.</p>

<p>In terms of actual "wrist" wearables like Apple Watch, I think we have to look at things like Nike Fuel and Fitbit in a different category. </p>

<p>Apple watch is different, from the moment they first talked about it you could tell they were entering the world of "Haute Horlogerie". </p>

<p>I used to wear a watch made out of Zirconium Oxide with a bullet-proof Sapphire glass. The face was made out of sandwiches of almost radioactive material handled by a team of 35 specialists in Florence and the one I wore was only made in 1000 units.</p>

<p><img alt="pam292-camera-case.jpg" src="/i/pam292-camera-case.jpg" width="580" height="246"  style="" /></p>

<p>I recognised this kind of language in the Apple announcement. The use of the word "complication" for example which I'm pretty sure 90% of iPhone buyers had never heard used in the context of a clock, the details of the straps and even the impossibly rare materials priced at "Haute Horlogerie" prices. </p>

<blockquote><p>The picture would be made complete if the "Edition" watch was impossible to find, only available from tiny boutiques known only to a few cognoscenti...</p></blockquote>

<p>I think the Apple Watch is interesting because it is disrupting a market that I'm guessing really didn't see this coming.</p>

<p>That said, Swiss Watch company Mondaine has launched a smart watch (http://www.mondaine.com/files/mondaine_helvetica_no_1_smart_...) which is a traditional automatic mechanism in a traditional steel case but with fitness sensors included and an integration with Android phones. A few others including Tag introduced smart watches at http://www.baselworld.com this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises"><img alt="pebble-time-metaphor.jpg" src="/i/pebble-time-metaphor.jpg" width="580" height="353"  style="" /></a></p>

<p>I recently backed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises">a Kickstarter project</a> called Pebble and am counting the minutes until I get my fabulous steel smartwatch. </p>

<p>The Pebble is different. It's more focused than the Apple watch and from a user experience point of view is designed from a more holistic, service design perspective. </p>

<p>For example, the clock face of the Pebble is designed to be used in darkness and light. After all, what's the point of a smartwatch that you can't read in sunlight? Its face isn't a screen but Kindle-like "digital paper" display readable even in bright sunshine. As a result of this approach, the battery life is much much longer than Apple Watch's.</p>

<p>Pebble also introduces a new interaction metaphor. Apple Watch has a groovy winder but as far as I can tell, the screen interactions seem very similar to what you're used to on a phone. Pebble on the other hand has re-visited the entire interface to follow a "time" metaphor. Everything you do on the Pebble fits into a timeline concept, where am I now? what is the future? the past etc.</p>

<p>I think these devices all look awesome and I want them now, but the ones I find most satisfying from a design perspective are the ones that explore the areas closest to the human (so Apple, try a little harder and how about a menstrual cycle calculator in your fitness app? No? Oops I forgot, not so many women on the design team) looking at the full journey of what we are all trying to achieve every day.</p>

        <a href="/adoption.html">User adoption formula</a>
    </h3>
    <div class="asset-content">
        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Folk have been asking me about this since I mentioned it in the <span class="caps">BCS </span>talk I did a few weeks ago. Just to be clear, "adoption" is the service creator's objective. For an ecommerce retailer it could be conversion or loading a basket or even agreeing to opt-in to something. For an enterprise customer adoption means the change will be painless because the user base is getting exactly what they felt they needed. For a marketing customer adoption will mean opening emails, setting a "like" flag, clicking on a banner or signing up for a sponsored download etc.</p>

<p><img alt="adoption formula" src="/i/aeav.png" width="580" height="132" style="padding:1em 0 1em 0;" /></p>

<p>Different types of objective but similar framework (original post below).</p>

<p>Have just received a brief from a prospect who wants to increase user adoption. Nothing unusual with that, expect that the wording of the request got me thinking. The request states that the solution is <em>greater usability</em>. In other words, that the level of adoption of a service is directly proportionate to its degree of usability.</p>

<p>I had to stop and think a bit. At first that makes sense, particularly if the current version of the service is really terrible.</p>

<p>But I think usability is the wrong measure. By modelling what the business wants to build into the service and aligning that with what the end users are trying to get out of it an increase in adoption is very likely.</p>

<p>Still, experience is more than alignment. We could get the service exactly right but if a roughly similar service has nicer music or offers free child-care we're likely to go with that alternative.</p>

<p>So it's a balance of alignment and value (in financial terms; emotional; physical; in terms of meaning and self-actualisation etc).</p>

<p>So not being a maths guy, does that make the formula:</p>

<p><strong>adoption = alignment x value over context</strong></p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>It's hard to work somewhere when you don't feel a strong sense of purpose. Equally, it gets you drunk with hope and belief to work somewhere the mission is clear and strong.</p>

<p>I've been researching statements of purpose from senior digital folk and came across this one from <span class="caps">WPP</span>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To develop and manage talent; <br />
to apply that talent, throughout the world, for the benefit of clients; <br />
to do so in partnership; <br />
to do so with profit</p></blockquote>

<p>Not sure about the way it scans but put another way, if Martin Sorrel's network of companies didn't exist there would be less developed and well-managed talent in the world. While I don't see empirical evidence of that it's a strong statement and one I can get behind:-)</p>

<p>Incidentally, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Sorrel in the ballroom of the Pierre on <span class="caps">E61</span>st in Manhattan when he announced his takeover of my employer's parent company (JWT) to the assembled troops. I've had a thing ever since and actually ended up in the UK because <span class="caps">IBM </span>didn't think they should keep their business with us after the merger.</p>

<p>But that's another story...</p>

        <a href="/etail-nightmares.html">Things that give ecommerce retailers nightmares?</a>
    </h3>
    <div class="asset-content">
        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>I was speaking to some consultants recently and we got to talking about empathy and what makes a great ecommerce consultant.</p>

<p>I believe empathy has to be one of the most important qualities of a good consultancy (or indeed of a quality senior manager with a virtual team in a matrix organisation). In some ways it's almost more important than some other core skills in that it's more likely to place the consultant's recommendations firmly under the customer's pain point.</p>

<p>Multi-channel retailers have questions and need some love and tenderness. Ideally, you should feel their pain. They have a bunch of things that keep them up at night and empathising with these will make for a better ecommerce experience consultant. </p>

<p>Here's a rough list (transcribed unformatted from my moleskine) of my favourite nightmares: </p>

<ul>
<li>Do I need analytics, retargeting, algorithmic recommendations, satisfaction survey tools? </li>
<li>Single customer view (oh yes... one of those would be nice)</li>
<li>Why does enterprise software cost so ridiculously much? (For the cost of a year's license for entry-level analytics I could hire three engineers?!?)</li>
<li>Marketing and communication, how much cash should I be giving Google? How can my trading team and my online marketing team work more closely together?</li>
<li>How do traditional insight teams (big database, big budget, slow staging) fit in the same plan as front-end analitics-driven teams (rapid staging, lower cost)?</li>
<li>How do I manage the difference in staging speed of different business silos (Experience team leading client-side but with the threat that my front-end is making promises to customer that my back-end can't deliver).</li>
<li>Platform issues: Where do I start!?! Performance, governance, maintenance, reliability, (in)flexibility, scalability</li>
<li>What data can I trust? How can I manage my progress?</li>
<li>Generally, how to I measure and manage the impact on my customer experience of:<ul>
<li>Range extension (marketplace, <span class="caps">OEM, </span>etc)</li>
<li><span class="caps">SKU </span>availability (allocation online/offline etc)</li>
<li>Delivery (number of men, suppliers, boxing and packaging issues)</li>
<li>Product information and imagery, access to exciting rich media etc</li>
<li>Selling and fulfilling across the channels (multichannel retail suffering!)</li>
<li>Social content</li>
<li><span class="caps">EPOS </span>disasters, why is it so hard to simply give the customer his pound coin back and why does he have to give his postcode?</li>
<li>Content management, why is it so hard to add, to change content?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Times are tough, how do I plan the amortisation of my improvements and "burn rate" for new initiatives?</li>
<li>How do I calculate the risk and plan the scheduling of the potential rewards?</li>
<li>Call centre costs and governance</li>
<li>Uniqueness (satisfying the promise of "unique experiences") - many/most platforms assume <span class="caps">SKU </span>interchangability, how do I create unique experiences when ecommerce platforms increasingly follow similar design patterns?</li>
<li>Should I be focusing on <span class="caps">GETTING THE BASICS RIGHT </span>or do I need to go get some new optimising technology?</li>
<li>What? Another javascript tag? Why does every vendor tell me it's easy-peasey to integrate their service, I just need to add a javascript tag? How in heaven's name am I supposed to manage the performance impact?</li>
<li>If I can't have bespoke channels, can I have bespoke categories (yes I can!)</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, quite a list:-) </p>

<p>I'm guessing there's a lot more, but even with this rough first draft, I can see some broad areas where a consultant might want to focus attention:</p>

<h2>Start with the "Digital Map"</h2>

<p>Where do we need to be in the mid-to-long term and what do we need to get there? Most businesses maintain a voice-of-the-customer report and maintain a "Customer Plan" these days. The Digital Map builds on those learnings and supports those commitments but with a focus on the elements that directly influence ecommerce performance.  </p>

<h2>What can I do today?</h2>

<p>While we work on a digital map we also need to think about YoY reporting and getting results as quickly as possible. A lot of the nightmares above can be at least addressed at this stage.</p>

<h2>Making stuff that works better, like a better online store</h2>

<p>A lot of the above touch on good old fashioned design and build. The consultant needs to be able to deliver a quantifiably better ecommerce website building on the customer's platform investment.</p>

<h2>Deeper fixes underpinning the online experience</h2>

<p>It's unlikely you're going to let me edit the Cobol that structures your mainframe's performance but somewhere between the ubiquitous <span class="caps">SAP </span>rollout-that-never-happens and cryogenic defrosting of top programmers active in 1979 there lies a wide scope of systems analysis and solutions analysis and architecture. You're going to want to offer those services too.</p>

<h2>If you can't measure it you can't...</h2>

<p>Ecommerce managers are some of the most accountable folk around. When your basket is dropping and your MI is a mess its easy to find your bonus under threat. These guys needs top-notch help with people, processes and performance measurement.</p>

<p>So lots to consider when choosing a consultant then:-)</p>
