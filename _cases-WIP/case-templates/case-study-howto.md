A case study example

Let’s go into the details on each one of the steps above, using a fictional example. Our business is Kumbo Digital and our client is Currigate.
1. Start with a clear headline

This should be like a newspaper headline that gives the most important information. A subtitle with supporting details or a customer quote is optional.

    Currigate Plugs $12k in Profit Leaks with Kumbo Digital

2. Provide a snapshot

There should be a section at the top with the important details. This includes

    Customer name/category/industry
    Product/service used
    Results (ideally three stats)

3. Introduce the client

Share one to two sentences with your customer’s name, industry, location, and a highlight.

    Currigate is a software service that offers highly customizable subscription packages to banks, brokers, and investors in the mortgage lending market. 

4. State the problem, consequences, & hesitations

Explain the issue the customer was facing or the goal they were having a hard time reaching—as well as the negative outcomes.

    While this high level of customization is what sets Currigate apart from its competitors, it also requires multiple applications with disparate data and heavy manual work. Account owners were spending so much time manage invoicing, there was little left over to build relationships with clients, stay on top of overages, and upsell. This was leading to leaks in profitability and a weakening of customer service. 

Include customer quotes as well as any hesitancies they had with using a product or service like yours.

    “We were getting in our own way,” said Melanie Grigham, Currigate’s VP of Operations. “Our customer relationships were starting to falter, and we knew we had to do something. But the thought of manipulating just one of our data sources—let alone all seven—was scary. There were so many random connections in place and so much confidential information, we couldn’t risk it all breaking.”

5. Describe the solution

Share how the customer found your business and why they chose you.

    Grigham learned about Kumbo Digital through none other than Google research and decided to get in touch. “The thought of explaining the whole thing felt daunting, but I was relieved to hear [the rep] finishing my sentences for me!”

Include which specific product or service they chose, how it was implemented, and how the customer used it. Stay brief!

    After learning the details of the situation, the Kumbo team proposed a custom solution that would integrate all of the data sources into one dashboard. “I was hesitant at first, but they showed me a small scale example which helped me to understand a little more about how it would work. I appreciated their patience with me as I took some time to make a decision.”

    Grigham finally went with it. The dashboard took three weeks to implement and the data migration took just under a day.

6. Share the results & benefits

Share how the client used your product/service, what the results were, and the benefits. Include direct quotes and clear evidence (statistical data, before-and-after images, time-lapse videos, etc.)

    With the new platform, Currigate’s account managers could access all seven data sources—as well as generate, track, send, and approve invoices—all in one place. Time spent invoicing went from days to hours, freeing up time for them to engage with customers and work toward strategic goals. “Our staff are less bogged down to the point where they’re asking to take on more clients—which is unheard of.”

    The redesigned and simplified product catalog (206 product codes instead of 1,024) has also made it easier for them to upsell as well as recommend combinations for specific needs. “Sometimes our new clients don’t know what they want, and this is perfect for giving them a starting point.”

    In addition, Currigate was able to identify $12,403 worth of overages they wouldn’t have caught otherwise. “Now, we can be sure that their customers are being billed appropriately (which is great for us) and receiving the services best fit for their dynamic needs (which is great for them). It’s a win-win.”

7. Conclude with words of advice and a CTA

Share where the client is headed, any additional quotes or praise, and/or their advice for similar potential clients.

    Today, Currigate’s unique subscription model is as strong as ever. It’s even considering opening up to new markets. “We never thought we’d reach this point so soon—we thought new markets was years down the line,” said Melanie. When asked what advice she had for other businesses like hers, she talked about mixing faith and facts. “You’ve got to do your research to find a trusted provider, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to a leap of faith, and sometimes you just have to do it.”

Finish off with a CTA to contact your business and/or a link to view more case studies.
