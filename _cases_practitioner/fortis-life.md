subtitle: >
  An Roinn Coimirce Sóisialaí, the Irish Dept. of Social Protection's inspector team was a set of stakeholders who were mostly over-sixties and broadly skeptical that much could be achieved to improve their workplace, and certainly not by adding any new-fangled mobile technology to the mix.

## Case 2) Fortis Life

### Problem

Technology company with budget and ground-breaking actuarial tech but no customer insight

### Solution

Recruit team and lead insight discovery (interviews, shadowing etc). Key insights uncovered:
- IFAs were perceived as not adding real value, simply pocketing fees at the expense of the customer.
- Life products were perceived as very complex
- The application for life products was arduous and often turned into an extended and frustrating experience for the customer

### Insight to product experience

Multi-channel service design approach:
- Design the application and servicing tools using spreadsheet patterns instead of input forms to create the idea that the IFA is partnering with the customer in value creation
- Design the back-office systems to promote collaborative behaviour from admins
- Create easy entry point for new IFAs with partner community management

### Results

Success metrics include:
- Scored 9.5 out of 10 in “Which”, their highest rating ever
- Big efficiency gains and 60% immediate decisions (ie without call-centre intervention)
- First year customer satisfaction survey showed 97.5% customer satisfaction
- Product experience rated F&TRC “eee” excellence (highest industry rating)
