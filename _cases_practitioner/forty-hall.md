## Project situation

A rare opportunity to work closely with a customer right from the inception of their brand. Forty Hall Vineyard had a range of needs: a corporate identity, packaging and labels, a comms platform, a strategy to guide how best to use social touchpoints to increase donation revenue.

My team at Avanade built the responsive site and I ran training sessions to bring the vineyard volunteers up to to a level where they could effectively self-support with their new tools.

## Action and outcomes

Experience director owning the client relationship and leading strategy, writing the brief, joining in sketching and guiding delivery. Additionally, I performed Apache configuration and coded CMS templates.

I guided the Vineyard team though the process of distilling and expressing their values and vision. led the creation of the Vineyard visual Identity, analysed the customer's target markets and briefed community managers, designers, and content writers.

## Brand and proposition

I took the customer through a series of workshops to identify the key drivers of the future brand. I analysed the competitive space and researched the likely customers for the wine. Working alongside a WSET-trained wine consultant, I mapped the planned vintages to a series or attitude segments and used those to drive the design brief.

The result was a map of three types of customer and four identity key values. Based on these, produced designs for the logo, bottle labels and the website.
