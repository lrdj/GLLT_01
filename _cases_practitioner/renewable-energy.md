title: "Helping an oil-and-gas giant align their retail business with their renewables transformation"

subtitle: >
  The oil and gas company did not know how to serve B2B e-mobility customers. They needed to learn how to serve these fleets, and how to monetise that relationship.

- **Insights and opportunities** Led primary research with e-mobility workers in Paris, exposing that research to date had incorrectly analysed user needs, context of use, and behaviour patterns. Provided data for my stakeholders to challenge assumptions, and opportunities to pivot to better options.
- **Strategic clarity** Took business stakeholders through assumptions mapping and testing. Mapped org structure and ownership of renewals transformation with them. Identified causes why business could not deliver a joint infrastructure and retail service proposition
- **Benefits realisation** Gave evidence to my customer allowing her to pivot away from the higher risk option to focus on delivering a better solution which she piloted 6 months later. As a result, the business in on track for delivering e-mobility solutions in time for the Olympics.


## The business problem and user need

![I needed to develop a plan that showed how the partners would collaborate.](/i/cases/renewables-e-mobility/plan.jpg)

- Wider challenges: Overlapping and sometimes conflicting needs of Energy Transformation and Retail stakeholders (how might we move away from fossil fuels while retaining our retail revenue?)
- Unclear governance, difficult to make progress (retail, transformation, network, corporate)
- Pressure from French team to keep momentum and build on catapult in time for Olympics

Our Operator Hub project objectives:

- Learn how to serve these fleets
- Learn how to make money


## Method / approach: Understanding the ecosystem people first

![The service would become a component of a complex ecosystem](/i/cases/renewables-e-mobility/speculative-design.jpg)

- What are the people doing?
- Insights (what's going on)?
- Forces at play?
- Assets available to build a future with?
- Opportunities (what could be improved)?

I found a complex stakeholder ecosystem, intersecting Energy transformation, Retail, Network, and the France opco. Different forces acted on these groups and different needs pulled them, yet to succeed, the project needed them to work as one.


## The design starting point

Startup catapult had run a short pilot last year. 

The project was characterised by loads of excitement but many untested assumptions around the business model. Energy transformation and Retail teams were building future plans on leadership opinions with little supporting data. In particular:
- What was the likely user base of the service
- Value-proposition, revenue sources and channels
- How to balance our proposition with 3rd sector partners and French State 


## My design decisions through the Service Design process

- Make site visits in Paris 
- Run contextual inquiry: In-car shadowing and on-street interviews, panel workshop

![Planning user research](/i/cases/renewables-e-mobility/UR.jpg)

My research uncovered important differences between leadership assumptions and observable reality. It improved the team's understanding of who our target users where, and what their needs were.

- decision-insight: The drivers do not have the pattern we thought they did
- decision-insight: The cars and scooters used by the companies do not have the constraints we thought they did (battery types, ownership contracts etc.)
- Assumptions mapping with cross-silo stakeholders

![The mapping exercise uncovered a number of important untested assumptions](/i/cases/renewables-e-mobility/assumptions-map.jpg)

The mapping exercise uncovered a number of important untested assumptions:
- Hub revenue to be driven by retail
- 3rd sector not necessary beyond PR
- Drivers needs are known


## The final output and result

![The final output and result](/i/cases/renewables-e-mobility/outcome.jpg)

I decided to recommend that the org pivot away from a retail-lead proposition which depended on charging gig-economy workers. They did with a pilot launch in Paris city centre and Roissy airport hub launched later that year.
