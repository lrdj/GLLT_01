  How might we provide a standardised global service when the culture of each market is very different and closing the deal means a very different type of conversation in Singapore from the one in Jordan...

## Project situation

Create a unified portal for BBC Enterprises' non-UK ad sales. 

The core challenge of the project was defining an experience framework that would support the different global organisations under one banner. The single repository of sales support materials and presales support such as sales team details would allow global customers to experience a familiar "BBC" quality experience while finding all they expected from their local sales organisation.

## Action and outcomes

I was contracted as an independent design consultant. 

This project is a good example of digital brand activation, as the core values of "trust" and "quality" needed to be conveyed in every part of the experience and the choices made in the design were based on digital planning activities to understand the market forces in play. In particular, I was able to conduct "design the box" activities with senior marketing stakeholders which allowed me to pinpoint and communicate the key drivers and values.

## Activities

- Stakeholder workshops
- International interviews
- User needs analysis
- Mental modelling
- Design the box (brand workshop)
- CMS strategy and Sitecore persona logic
- Wireframe specification
