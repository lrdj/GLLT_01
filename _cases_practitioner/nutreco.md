subtitle: >
  An Roinn Coimirce Sóisialaí, the Irish Dept. of Social Protection's inspector team was a set of stakeholders who were mostly over-sixties and broadly skeptical that much could be achieved to improve their workplace, and certainly not by adding any new-fangled mobile technology to the mix.

### Case 1) Nutreco at work

Problem:
No collaboration software
Many companies under 'holding co' umbrella

Insights:
Identifying the powerful cultural threads that connected the companies
"we are all engineers who want to fix things"
"everything is better when everyone helps solve the problem"
"I'm not looking for a document, I'm looking for what a colleague said or thought"

Solution:
Human network drives document search "the people who were at that conference 3 years ago" --> document retrieval

Results:
Happy O365
Thanks you video from leadership team
