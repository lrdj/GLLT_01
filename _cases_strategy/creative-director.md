title: "Leading pitches, luxury brands in the Chinese market"

subtitle: >
  Question: How might we take a traditional European luxury brand with a decades-old narrative centred on the resonant imagery of Italy and the popular culture of decadent Mediterranean 1960s into a new market, leveraging the history, keepping the edge, but resonating with new buyers from a different cultural background?

It sounds like you're working on an innovative concept for marketing Bulgari in China, centered around the "Girl meets Gem" jewellery rental service. Let's break down the concepts you've provided and create visual material for your pitch:

1. **"Every child is raised as a gem"**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A diverse group of young Chinese women, each adorned with a unique piece of Bulgari jewelry, standing confidently against a backdrop of supportive family members. The family members gaze at the women with pride and admiration.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A young girl gazing into a jewelry box, her reflection in the mirror showing her as a grown woman adorned with a stunning gem, symbolizing her journey of individuality and femininity.

2. **Young Chinese buy luxury goods to express individuality and social status**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A young Chinese woman attending a high-profile event, wearing a different piece of Bulgari jewelry each time she's pictured, emphasizing the notion of never being seen in the same jewel twice.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A silhouette of a woman standing out in a crowd, her Bulgari jewelry shining brightly, illustrating her unique identity and elevated social status.

3. **Young Chinese buy for the now**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A Chinese woman joyfully selecting a piece of Bulgari jewelry from the rental service, her expression radiating happiness and spontaneity.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A balance scale, with one side holding coins (representing savings) and the other side holding a sparkling Bulgari jewel, tipping in favor of the jewel, representing the preference for immediate luxury.

4. **Jewelry for everyday luxury**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A diverse group of Chinese women going about their daily activities – working, shopping, exercising – each adorned with Bulgari jewelry, bringing luxury to their everyday moments.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A calendar with regular days marked with small jewels and special occasions marked with larger gems, symbolizing the integration of luxury into everyday life.

5. **Desire for expert guidance in shopping**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A gem therapist in an elegant Bulgari showroom, sitting across from a young Chinese woman. They're in deep conversation, with various pieces of jewelry laid out between them.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A compass with a Bulgari jewel at its center, pointing the way, symbolizing the gem therapist's role in guiding consumers through their jewelry choices.

1.“Every child is raised as a gem”. 
- Every child has multiple adults pouring their aspirations and finances into them. Each child feels they are a unique individual. 
- The ‘redefining femininity’ concept allows women to select (or even customise/create?) the jewel that they feel best expresses their individuality, their femininity. 
- See also gem therapist (full description below), who provides a fully personalised Gem service for each individual according to their needs, values and calendar.
2. Young Chinese buy luxury goods to express this individuality and to show their social status - to stand out rather than fit in.
Also taps into a wider element of this insight; that it is more important to be seen to be wealthy than to actually be wealthy. 
- A jewellery rental service allows women to give the impression of wealth, by being seen wearing multiple different luxury jewels, or “never being seen wearing the same jewel twice’” 
3. Young Chinese buy for the now rather than saving for tomorrow. “You make half of what you spend” 
- A jewellery rental service allows consumers with smaller finances to tap into this sentiment and buy ‘in the moment’ to make them feel good. 
4. For young Chinese, jewellery is no longer reserved for special occasions; it is a way to bring luxury to everyday moments. 
  - A jewellery rental service allows women to bring luxury to everyday moments, rather than saving for weddings etc, they are able to afford flashes of luxury when they feel like it. 
5. Young Chinese are bombarded with choice. They want experts to understand their desires and help them make decisions when shopping. 

A Gem therapist (a crucial part of the service which we have not yet fully detailed in the video due to time), goes beyond the notion of a personal shopper. The therapist will book in an hour consultation with a consumer, to understand their current values, goals, and what’s important to them across their year – as well as their calendar of events. They will then suggest or select jewels that help them express themselves or celebrate certain key moments in their year.
