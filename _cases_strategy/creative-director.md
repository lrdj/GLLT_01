title: "Leading pitches, luxury brands in the Chinese market"

subtitle: >
  Question: How might we take a traditional European luxury brand with a decades-old narrative centred on the resonant imagery of Italy and the popular culture of decadent Mediterranean 1960s into a new market, leveraging the history, keeping the edge, but resonating with new buyers from a different cultural background?

## Tim's concept

Value chains are replacing brands are the most powerful weapon in the marketing arsenal.

While still widely perceived as source of risk, value-chain transparency actually offers brand owners an opportunity to create new forms of value for customers at an emotional and ethical level—the level where brands have traditionally operated.

In contrast to brands, the equity currently locked within value chains is real, testable and valuable to end-users. Learning to release this value is the key to sustainable competitive advantage.


## Market context for the pitch: insight and background

The Bulgari brand has been taken in a some unexpected directions over the years. After the meltdown of 2008, they overhauled their North American business to move away from the fine art gems were know for, to focus on more 'affordable' accessories. 

> ...luxury is no longer about money;<br>the currency of knowledge is more powerful.

This may have not been a great move: Once one can afford anything – a jet, a six-figure watch, the walled spread on Anguilla – luxury transforms into something shaped by knowledge and access, not acquisition. Buying luxury is no longer about money; the currency of knowledge is more powerful. In other words, the driver of luxury markets is not price, ubiquity, inventory availability or distribution, yet that seemed to be their decision.

In the decade since that decision, the push for authenticity, and the concept of knowledge worth paying for has certainly picked up steam. Greater interest in things from online review sites, to concierge services, has revealed this to be the case. Would Bulgari have been smarter to keep their exclusivity and do a better job of transmitting the knowledge?

But today, the North American luxury consumer is no longer the target, and digital is enabling new engagement with younger audiences without a race to the bottom on position.


## How might the creative approach steer a classic story towards new places while still anchoring and building on the unique brand history and cultural equity?

<figure><img alt="Anita and Marcello doing their thing in the Trevi fountain" src="/i/cases/bulgari/la-dolce-vita.jpg"><figcaption>During the flourishing Dolce Vita years of the 50's and 60's, Bvlgari definitively came to the attention of the world's elite. This was increased by the city's bustling cinematic traditions and by the American film industry beginning to produce movies and expensive epics in Rome dubbed “Hollywood on the Tiber”.</figcaption></figure>

Legendary movies like Roman Holidays or La Dolce Vita made the Eternal City forever ingrained in the imagination as a magical place to visit at least once in your lifetime.
At the same time, names such as Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, Anita Ekberg and many others discovered the Bvlgari shop in Via Condotti and engaged in a passionate affairs with Bvlgari jewels both on and off the screen.



# Innovative concepts for marketing Bulgari in China


## "Girl meets Gem" jewellery rental service

We developed a number of concepts:

1. **"Every child is raised as a gem"**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A diverse group of young Chinese women, each adorned with a unique piece of Bulgari jewelry, standing confidently against a backdrop of supportive family members. The family members gaze at the women with pride and admiration.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A young girl gazing into a jewelry box, her reflection in the mirror showing her as a grown woman adorned with a stunning gem, symbolizing her journey of individuality and femininity.

2. **Young Chinese buy luxury goods to express individuality and social status**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A young Chinese woman attending a high-profile event, wearing a different piece of Bulgari jewelry each time she's pictured, emphasizing the notion of never being seen in the same jewel twice.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A silhouette of a woman standing out in a crowd, her Bulgari jewelry shining brightly, illustrating her unique identity and elevated social status.

3. **Young Chinese buy for the now**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A Chinese woman joyfully selecting a piece of Bulgari jewelry from the rental service, her expression radiating happiness and spontaneity.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A balance scale, with one side holding coins (representing savings) and the other side holding a sparkling Bulgari jewel, tipping in favor of the jewel, representing the preference for immediate luxury.

4. **Jewelry for everyday luxury**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A diverse group of Chinese women going about their daily activities – working, shopping, exercising – each adorned with Bulgari jewelry, bringing luxury to their everyday moments.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A calendar with regular days marked with small jewels and special occasions marked with larger gems, symbolizing the integration of luxury into everyday life.

5. **Desire for expert guidance in shopping**:
   - **Image Description (Photo)**: A gem therapist in an elegant Bulgari showroom, sitting across from a young Chinese woman. They're in deep conversation, with various pieces of jewelry laid out between them.
   - **Image Description (Illustration)**: A compass with a Bulgari jewel at its center, pointing the way, symbolizing the gem therapist's role in guiding consumers through their jewelry choices.

1.“Every child is raised as a gem”. 
- Every child has multiple adults pouring their aspirations and finances into them. Each child feels they are a unique individual. 
- The ‘redefining femininity’ concept allows women to select (or even customise/create?) the jewel that they feel best expresses their individuality, their femininity. 
- See also gem therapist (full description below), who provides a fully personalised Gem service for each individual according to their needs, values and calendar.
2. Young Chinese buy luxury goods to express this individuality and to show their social status - to stand out rather than fit in.
Also taps into a wider element of this insight; that it is more important to be seen to be wealthy than to actually be wealthy. 
- A jewellery rental service allows women to give the impression of wealth, by being seen wearing multiple different luxury jewels, or “never being seen wearing the same jewel twice’” 
3. Young Chinese buy for the now rather than saving for tomorrow. “You make half of what you spend” 
- A jewellery rental service allows consumers with smaller finances to tap into this sentiment and buy ‘in the moment’ to make them feel good. 
4. For young Chinese, jewellery is no longer reserved for special occasions; it is a way to bring luxury to everyday moments. 
  - A jewellery rental service allows women to bring luxury to everyday moments, rather than saving for weddings etc, they are able to afford flashes of luxury when they feel like it. 
5. Young Chinese are bombarded with choice. They want experts to understand their desires and help them make decisions when shopping. 

A Gem therapist (a crucial part of the service which we have not yet fully detailed in the video due to time), goes beyond the notion of a personal shopper. The therapist will book in an hour consultation with a consumer, to understand their current values, goals, and what’s important to them across their year – as well as their calendar of events. They will then suggest or select jewels that help them express themselves or celebrate certain key moments in their year.
