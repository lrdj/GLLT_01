intro: >
  I've been helping teams create blueprints for many years now and have picked up on a couple of themes. This means there probably isn't one 'ideal' form the blueprint, but there are definitely things to keep in mind while creating them.

Some thoughts on what 'best in class' might actually mean...

Example 1) The blueprint build by a team during a 2-day off-site.

What makes it work:
- They did it together
- They built it based on problem space observations mixed with principles

Why is it good:
- It uncovered the shape of possible solutions to improve performance
it created a consensus around the problem/solution
- it was a fun, team-building activity

The process the team went through:

The blueprint:

As you can see, it looks nasty, but was very effective.

Example 2) The blueprint with a thematic 'lens' (data accuracy in this example)
What makes it good:
The lens allows the problem space to be measured. In this blueprint, the bottom row shows data
accuracy. When red, the end-customer's data is incorrect. When green, the data is accurate. In
the case of this service (PAYE tax collection) when the the data is broken, bad things happen to
people. This tool helped motivate HMRC teams to improve.

Example 3) Blueprints showing capability overlaps along the customer journey
What makes it good:
This org was made up of 5 separate business units, but by blueprinting together, they identified
overlaps and common capabilities. This resulted in better performance and review or workflows
In this case, another tool - the tube map - allowed the design team to share the structure and
connections between organisational

Just to be clear, "adExample" is the service creator's objective. For an eco

![adExample formula](/i/aeav.png)

Different types of objective but similar framework (original post 

exactly right but if a roughly similar service has nicer music or offers free child-care we're likely to go with that alternative.

So it's a balance of alignment and value (in financial terms; emotional; physical; in terms of meaning and self-actualisation etc).

So not being a maths guy, does that make the formula:

*adExample = alignment x value over context*

What do you think?
