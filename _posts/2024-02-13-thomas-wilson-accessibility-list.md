title: "Thomas Wilson's very helpful accessibility list"

subtitle: >
  Debbie Levitt suggested that Thomas post his list on Medium or something as inside the LinkedIn walled garden, content seems to disappear on the whim of an algorythm. So I figured I'd post it here. This URL isn't going anywhere:-)

intro: >
  So you want to design for Accessibility? Accessibility focuses on the access and benefits of your site, system, or application for everyone. It's an important part of design and should be considered <em>BEFORE</em> the development process.
