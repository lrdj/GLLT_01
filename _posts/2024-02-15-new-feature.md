So I witnessed something unusual at lunch today...

I watched a colleague use her phone to perform a regular task and be surprised by the arrival of a new feature that had been deployed at the last update (she doesn't read release notes and never watches tutorial videos).

What's (very?) unusual about this is:

- She was not interrupted by the new feature
- She was able to understand the new feature without explanation
- As she completed her task, the value brought about by the new feature became immediately apparent
- The new feature did not change the value of her financial arrangement with the vendor in any way
- The new feature did not cause the UI to break with the zoom setting she uses (New York Times she's looking grumpily at you on that front...)
- The feature did not add complexity or slow down her experience
- There was no muscle memory driven usage that she could no longer do after the feature was released 

Overall, this update improved her experience, helped her cocreate value, improved her security, made her feel safer, and let her do her task more quickly.

I may be exaggerating but it's been literally years since I've experienced something like this.

What does it mean? I'm not sure, but I thought I'd share...
