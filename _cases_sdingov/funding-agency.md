title: Setting up a policy lab to accellerate policy creation at a government funding agency

subtitle: >
  A digital solution driven by agile test-and-learn can't deliver on policy intent when that intent has not previously been crafted into a set of coherent policies. Sometimes you need to design policy and delivery as one thing.

I understand that the book is [the strategy is delivery](https://public.digital/publications), and that was great back when we were stuck in waterfall, but sometimes, the delivery just won't work until the policy is right.


## The Challenge

As clearly articulated in the Government’s UK Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap published in July 2020, the people, knowledge, ideas, infrastructure and networks that make up the UK's research and innovation system are the fuel for UK prosperity. They support economic growth and productivity, the richness of our culture, efficient and effective public services, as well as fostering private investment and tackling national and global challenges.

Yes, but this funding of research had to be fair.

This government agency had a clear ministerial remit to change the way funding was allocated to universities and research institutes. For years, the bulk of the funding had gone to Russell group schools and it was felt that taxpayers money should be disbursed more intelligently and in such a way as to promote equity in research and educational opportunity.


## My role on the project

I was retained as an independent service design consultant by the integrator tasked with building the digital solution that would allow researchers to apply for funding. I joined a small team with also included interaction and content designers as well as user researchers.

  The yellow 'Circle Line' represents the policy team. They are in a continuous iteration loop where they define problems in response to strategy imperatives. They meet twice a week, and delivery teams engage with them at various key points in the process.

Hopes & fears cards
We use images at the beginning of a project to get people using a different side of their brain, and to pick ones that visually represent a hope they have for the project or a fear. It’s a good way to understand the motivations of different people in the room right from the start.

Challenge setting
Challenge setting is our way of finding the right question to answer. It takes many iterations!! By asking why five times, we can get to the route causes of the issue. And by asking ‘how can we?’ (as opposed to ‘how can I?’ we open up possibilities to a wider set of ideas which require more than one department.

Personas
Personas are real or hypothetical descriptions of people who might be experiencing the policy or service. They help us to empathise with people, think about their needs and design policy that fits them. We use evidence to develop them and do a segmentation to avoid them becoming stereotypes.

Journey mapping
‘User Journeys’ are a step by step map showing how people interact with services.
They can identify the highs and lows and therefore what aspects new ideas can build on or improve.

Ethnography
‘Design ethnography’ is the study of people and behaviours from their point of view. Building insight and ideas by shadowing users or spending time with them and discussing their lived experience in real life contexts. Films and photos can be extremely powerful in creating empathy and generating ideas.

Data science
Through data science we can identify new knowledge, patterns and insights gained from large volumes of data. We can use new forms of real-time, digital data. Data visualisations like this Sankey diagram allows non-analysts to spot patterns and trends. And powerful clustering techniques can segment groups far faster than any human can.

Evidence safari
An evidence safari is a technique we use to get groups of people to explore large amounts of data quickly, spot gaps and build insight from which to generate ideas. Here, we are using evidence in the form of charts and graphs,
but also humanised into persona stories that people can relate to.

Idea sketch sheets
We use creative methods to help people come up with new ideas. Sketching can help share germs of ideas during co- design sessions with stakeholders.

Open ideas days
Policy Jams and open ideas days help engage wider stakeholders with policy areas and co-develop ideas. They often start by exploring evidence or asking stakeholders to share their experiences, and then generate ideas as a result.

Speculative design
Speculative design imagines possible (rather than probably or predictable) futures and then creates an object or image from them. This tangible ‘thing’ allows to engage the public in a debate about whether we not we want that type of future, and what we would need to do to get there (or avoid it). Research before situations exist.

Service blueprints
‘Service blueprints’ and ‘Value maps’ can help show the relationship between different parts of the system now and in the future. We have adapted these for Government so they map out how a user experiences a policy, as well as the specifically Government functions (legislation, regulation, funding) make this happen.


Prototyping
An early model or mock-up built to test a concept, so it can be replicated or learned from. Prototypes help quickly build a service or policy idea to test assumptions. These can be made out of paper (like this online crime reporting tool) or tried out in real situations.

## Success

As a result of collaboration and new insights our policy projects deliver better outcomes at lower cost.
Our projects are being scaled and achieving savings. The Police Digitisation project is being rolled out across England & Wales, saving £3.7m.
We have also reached many more through the open policy-making toolkit, Policy Lab blog and slideshare which altogether have had over 50,000 views.
 


A key part of delivering on that commitment included the development of the Properties in Care Asset Management System (PiCAMS), which was designed to provide a single live digital system to link, manage and access data from sites provided by a wide variety of surveys and tools governed by a number of new, or updated policies and processes.

The digital leader coordinating that work found herself in a situation where things were moving increasingly fast, but she didn't feel she had enough information to feel comfortable her decisions where the best option.


## What I did

I was retained directly by her as a consultant and spend a short amount of time working with this leader and her teams to assess the situation.

Our work together focussed on some of her key issues:

- Designs for the information architecture, and the front end of the new information management toolset where being produced by her developers. This was not an ideal situation, but pragmatically, she had needed to show progress, and this is what was possible
- Integration of certain specific technical features into the front-end experience were presenting challenges. It was not clear to her that for all the dev effort involved, these features were necessary, or providing measurable value to end users
- While this leader was both trained and experienced in agile delivery, she wanted a second opinion regarding her plan and the definition of her team's outputs


## The outcomes

Working onsite in a very transparent and collaborative manner I was able to quickly learn about the people and systems at a high level. This was just enough information so that when paired with my extensive experience of public-sector service delivery I was able to form useful recommendations for my customer.

With her product vision and delivery strategy validated, my client was able to write the required business cases and confidently plan her next move.

Her ultimate service delivery was a happy one, with the collaboration and knowledge management tool a great success for HES.
