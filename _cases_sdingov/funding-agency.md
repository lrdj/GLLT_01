title: Setting up a policy lab to accellerate policy creation at a government funding agency

subtitle: >
  A digital solution driven by agile test-and-learn can't deliver on policy intent when that intent has not previously been crafted into a set of coherent policies. Sometimes you need to design policy and delivery as one thing.

I understand that the book is [the strategy is delivery](https://public.digital/publications), and that was great back when we were stuck in waterfall, but sometimes, the delivery just won't work until the policy is right.


## The Challenge

The people, knowledge, ideas, infrastructure and networks that make up the UK's research and innovation system support economic growth and productivity. They support the richness of our culture, efficient and effective public services, as well as fostering private investment and tackling national and global challenges.

Yes, but how these people and their research is funded has to be fair.

This government agency had a clear ministerial remit to change the way funding was allocated to universities and research institutes. For years, the bulk of the funding had gone to Russell group institutions and it was felt that taxpayers money should be disbursed more intelligently and in such a way as to promote equity in research and educational opportunity.


## My role on the project

I was retained as an independent service design consultant by the integrator tasked with building the digital solution that would allow researchers to apply for funding. I joined a small team which also included interaction and content designers as well as user researchers. 


## What I did

As I worked though our initial discovey phase, running challenge setting exercises, creating personas, building journey maps, and understanding the emotions and constraints of the end-user applicatand who would need to use our new system, it became apparent that the digital delivery unity was building tools without understanding exactly what problems they were solving.

Given the time previously invested and the compexity of the stakeholder landscape

  The yellow 'Circle Line' represents the policy team. They are in a continuous iteration loop where they define problems in response to strategy imperatives. They meet twice a week, and delivery teams engage with them at various key points in the process.

## Success

As a result of collaboration and new insights our policy projects deliver better outcomes at lower cost.
Our projects are being scaled and achieving savings. The Police Digitisation project is being rolled out across England & Wales, saving Â£3.7m.
We have also reached many more through the open policy-making toolkit, Policy Lab blog and slideshare which altogether have had over 50,000 views.
