title: Cabinet Office data sharing service discovery and service assessment

subtitle: >
  Barriers to data sharing still exist across government. A lack of alignment between organisations in data sharing systems and processes resulted in different approaches to navigating the complexities of legal and ethical compliance. It's hard and it takes forever...

## Background context

The customer believed this alignment could be improved with a “unified” way to facilitate voluntary, trusted, and responsible avenues for cross-government data sharing. 

A significant impediment to data sharing in government is that it is slow and difficult to establish a data sharing arrangement because of misalignments and inconsistencies in processes, governance and documentation between organisations.


## Future vision

I was tasked with exploring how this proposition of a cross-government service might work. 

The service would would provide a single, agreed process to establish data sharing arrangements, guided workflow, ability to collaborate across organisational boundaries, standardised documentation, sign-off functionality and digital memorandums of understanding, in a secure and access-controlled web environment.

The aspiration was that it would become quicker and easier to establish safe, responsible and legal data sharing arrangements, enabling the sharing of vital information to solve problems and deliver services at pace.


## The design: Purpose of prototype

This build was created in order to test design speculations during an Alpha phase of service design. 

The speculations were ideated after reviewing discovery phase outputs and performing initial rounds of user research in the current phase. The "what if" design speculations build on the central "How might we" user need which is:

>
> In order to better meet my service users' needs, 
> I need to build data that is not managed by my department into my service
>

The prototype acts as stimulus for user research. It was designed to test the following speculations:

- "What if we created an online community hub where the data community could learn about sharing best practise, search for data sets, and find contact details of relevant data owners"
- "What if we didn't build an end-to-end service, but instead provided wizards that helped data acquirers and data suppliers write better responses and better requests? What would happen if those wizards positioned the information that is most often missing from submissions nearer to the start of the flow?"
- "What if we took the impact assessment and the contract that are normally handled at the conclusion of the negotiation process, and moved them to the beginning in a starter-for-ten format? How would civil servants react to that?"
- "What if we created a space that would allow supplier and acquirer to collaborate and manage their documentation in one, secure, shared space? Specifically, would the benefits of an audit trail, centralised storage etc. outweigh the cost of complexity and the overhead of learning a new system?"


## Users and journey structure

The flow is designed to test the actions of acquirers, suppliers, and subject matter experts, as they move from finding data, applying for a data share, negotiating the agreement, and supplying the data. The diagram above shows the data flows supported in the current version of the prototype.

The research is currently ongoing.
