  Barriers to data sharing still exist across government. A previous Discovery found that a lack of alignment between organisations in data sharing systems and processes resulted in different approaches to navigating the complexities of legal and ethical compliance.

## Background context

The customer believed this alignment could be improved with a “unified” way to facilitate voluntary, trusted, and responsible avenues for cross-government data sharing. 

A significant impediment to data sharing in government is that it is slow and difficult to establish a data sharing arrangement because of misalignments and inconsistencies in processes, governance and documentation between organisations.

The focus for the Alpha was ‘how might a process for data sharing be created that allows for proactive, simpler and faster data sharing, with clear principles for building consistent and coordinated cross-government data sharing governance?’


## Future vision

I was tasked with exploring how this proposition of a cross-government service might work. The service would would provide a single, agreed process to establish data sharing arrangements, guided workflow, ability to collaborate across organisational boundaries, standardised documentation, sign-off functionality and digital memorandums of understanding, in a secure and access-controlled web environment.

The aspiration was that it would become quicker and easier to establish safe, responsible and legal data sharing arrangements, enabling the sharing of vital information to solve problems and deliver services at pace.
