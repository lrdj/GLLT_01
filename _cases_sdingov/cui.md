title: HMRC Conversational user interface (CUI)

subtitle: >
  Demand for support from HMRC ebbs and flows with the movement of the financial year. The CUI assistant was designed to complement telephone and webchat support, helping customers self-serve by offering quick and queue-free answers to simple questions and providing much wanted 24-7 help with support during the pandemic.

## The challenge

The team at Education Scotland had been evaluating the need for a transformation programme to look at how training materials for educators ("professional learning") were created, promoted, distributed, and maintained. 

While some useful work had been completed, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown turned an ongoing programme of improvement into something much more urgent.


## My role

I acted as an independent consultant, retained by a digital transformation agency and tasked with leading the service design discovery. I collaborated with a team of BAs, user researchers, and technical architects. 


## What I did

I established a design-led approach where, over the course of eight weeks, our team worked with our customer through the following three phases:

The use of virtual assistants in the online services for the Covid support programmes – including the furlough and the Self-Employment Income Support Schemes – helped many users find what they were looking for when they would otherwise have resorted to phoning an HMRC helpline. This delivered the department an estimated £5m in “cost-avoidance” savings, McMann said.

Such success helped to accelerate the use of the technology, according to the digital product chief, and the department has plans to expand the use of conversational UI to the HMRC app – where it will be deployed “imminently”, she said.

“It will be the front door [where], instead of customers having to navigate and find information themselves, the ambition is, on the digital channels – particularly in the app… there will be a menu where you can self-serve, but you also have the option of just typing in what it is that you need, and we surface that,” McMann added.

HMRC will also shortly undertake a pilot exercise – using Microsoft’s Nuance technology – to explore the use of generative AI in its use of chatbots.

“We will look at how we can use that to better improve the customer experience by analysing the intents [to provide] better responses,” McMann said.

















### Insights and opportunities

- Identify core users and their key pain points
- Review current state / as-is service
- Create as-is user journeys and a service blueprint
- Understand the technical architecture

### Future vision

- Express a clear vision of the potential future state / to-be service, leveraging uncovered improvement opportunities
- Identify enablers and technical architecture
- Draft a set of principles to guide future design and development, aligned to the Scottish Government’s "Digital First" standards

### What next

In the opportunities phase, I led teams of civil servants through ideation exercises. These included "Crazy 8s", a limbering up exercise that lets participants feel the permission to think freely. 

These were followed by a solution sketching session where each participant worked quietly to flesh out their idea. These where photographed by each participant and emailed to me.

The opportunities the cross-functional teams uncovered centred on transforming the course creation lifecycle to:
