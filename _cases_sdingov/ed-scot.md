title: Education Scotland professional learning discovery

subtitle: >
  How might Education Scotland test their assumption that the transformation of their "Professional Learning" lifecycle offered significant opportunities to improve relationships with practitioners? This eight-week discovery project aimed to de-risk those assumptions and build a vision of a possible future for the agency's service to the teachers of Scotland.

## Future vision

With stakeholders, Dug and the team co-designed and co-created a future vision of the Professional Learning service and identified opportunities to deliver transformational change.

The vision has four key areas

1) **Focussed on the practitioner** In the future, we will nurture closer relationships with Scotland’s practitioners.

2) **Structured for enhanced findability** We will interlock our content design, information architecture, and indexing. Findability will apply to both internal and external searches as well as in services we aggregate.

3) **Organised for improved quality** We will shorten both long-term and short-term feedback loops.
We will integrate performance data with a design-led approach, supported by our educational frameworks.

4) **Enabled for greater relevance and deeper engagement** We will communicate with intent. We will understand what our audience needs to achieve and we will tailor our services to the unique needs of the individual.

### The Challenge

How PL is created, promoted, distributed and maintained currently 

Situation
---------

Legacy 
- Existing professional learning of a high quality but:
  - difficult to access
  - Access to professional learning 
- no integrated learning management system (LMS)

insights and opps
-----------------

Transformation of ES' Professional Learning lifecycle offers a significant opportunity to focus on the education practitioner's learning and development needs, and nurture closer relationships with them. In addition, it will improve the day-to-day experience of the staff responsible for delivering the Professional Learning service.

The Discovery project team has undertaken a user-centred, multi-disciplinary review to understand the current Professional Learning service. The team has conducted an ‘as-is’ analysis to understand the current service, the needs of the users who provide and interact with the service and the technical landscape that supports and enables the service.

With stakeholders, the team co-designed and co-created a future vision of the Professional Learning service and identified opportunities to deliver transformational change.

# Disco: Overall Purpose

The overall purpose of a Discovery is to understand the problems to be solved and the needs of potential service users:

1. What are the user and business needs?
2. How is the service provided today?
3. What could we do to improve the service?
4. What would we need to progress into an Alpha project?
5. Document the findings and recommendations to enable the business to make a decision about next steps
 
## Disco specific objectives

- Analyse the current (as-is) state
- Provide a vision of the future (to-be) state

# 1. Executive summary

Introduction

This report summarises our main findings, including:

- A review of the current state / as-is service, including a service journey blueprint, the core users, the technical architecture and the key pain points users experience
- A vision of the potential future state / to-be service, including improvement opportunities, enablers and technical architecture
- Design principles to guide future design and development, aligned to the Scottish Government’s Digital First Standards
- Recommendations for delivering:
  - An Alpha project, to begin delivering change, and the Alpha team required
  - A further Discovery project, to explore parts of the service this Discovery could not as not all users were available.


## Key findings

There is a general lack of consistency in delivering Professional Learning
Many teams across the directorates are responsible for delivering Professional Learning to education practitioners. They all follow different processes, use different tools, publish to different locations and use different technology throughout the service journey. A lack of consistency means that it takes Education Scotland staff longer to become proficient and it costs more to provide the different service solutions.

There is a lack of a communal, collaborative toolset
The teams responsible for delivering Professional Learning do not share a common toolset and do not have tools and technology that enables them to collaborate when designing, creating and publishing Professional Learning. As a result, these activities take longer to perform.
It is not easy, and it takes too long to understand the impact on education practitioners and their
classrooms

There is no standard mechanism or process for gathering feedback and insight from education practitioners who have consumed the Professional Learning provided. There is a reliance on the Scrutiny teams’ school reports and thematic reports to identify what is working well and not so well. A lack of data and a means to analyse it means the impact in the classroom cannot be easily measured on an ongoing basis.
Everyone finds it hard to find Professional Learning content, events and other artefacts

There is no single source of the truth – Professional Learning can be accessed from multiple websites and sources, making it difficult for education practitioners and Education Scotland staff to find it, which means some education practitioners may be missing out on development opportunities and some of Education Scotland’s Professional Learning may not be up to date.

## Recommended next steps

The project team has identified a number of improvement opportunities, which Education Scotland should explore to deliver the vision described in section 5.

One specific opportunity has been identified as a candidate for progressing to the Alpha phase and another for a Discovery phase. Both require input and collaboration from the education practitioners.

- Alpha candidate
Create a collaborative culture and environment

- Discovery candidate
Improve the short-term feedback loop

# 2. Overview

A brief outline of the scope and objectives of the Professional Learning Discovery and the approach taken by the project team

## Overview

### Reasons for undertaking the study

Education Scotland (ES) provides support to Scotland’s education practitioners (Practitioners). This involves Education Scotland creating Professional Learning content (PL), which includes face-to-face seminars, meetings, webinars, resource material, policy guidance, videos, online professional learning activities, leadership programmes, collaborations with external stakeholders, national events and international engagement. This PL is consumed by Scotland’s education practitioners.

As Education Scotland has evolved, so has its approach to supporting the professional development of Scotland’s Practitioners. In April 2018, following a governance review by the Scottish Government, a new organisational structure was put in place, comprising five directorates, including the Professional Learning and Leadership (PLL) directorate.

All of the directorates provide PL to support Practitioners and their personal development. Whilst the directorates follow a similar high-level user journey to design, create, deliver, evaluate and maintain PL, i.e. the PL lifecycle, there are many differences in the approach, the processes, the tools and the technology used.

Digital transformation of the PL lifecycle offers significant opportunities to support Education Scotland’s strategy to be a leading digital public sector organisation in Scotland, have streamlined corporate systems and staff with high levels of digital skills to select and use the best technology options to deliver their work. 

The recommendations outlined in this document align with Education Scotland’s digital strategy, which aims to support professional learning in Scottish education.
A key objective is to use digital technology to create an effective learning environment for Scotland's educators, allowing them to find and access learning activities easily and intuitively, and to record their progress without increasing teacher workload or administrative burden.

### Problem statement

"Professional Learning Delivery"

How might Education Scotland easily and consistently create and maintain impactful, compliant, relevant professional learning artefacts to ensure Scotland's teachers are supported throughout the continual improvements in learning, teaching, and assessment?

### Discovery purpose: Specific objectives

The objectives of the Professional Learning Discovery, as agreed with DTS and documented in the Statement of Work, is split into two main areas:

1. An analysis of the current (as-is) state
  - To understand how practitioners can consume PL from Education Scotland (e.g. webinar, CBT, video, policy guidance)
  - To understand and document how PL:
    - Is created within each area of the organisation
    - Where it is stored
    - Is managed post-creation
    - Is assessed for practitioner impact
  - To understand the PL lifecycle
2. Provide a vision of the future (to-be) state
  - To understand how the PL lifecycle could be improved or automated
  - To identify a proposed to-be working state for the delivery of impactful PL

### Discovery purpose: User research methodology

**Discussion guides**

Discussion guides were written by the user researcher based on initial conversations with the project team and client. This was reviewed and validated with the project team before and after the first interview.

Sense making sessions involving the project team took place at the end of most days to discuss the main themes coming out of the interviews. Any additional insights from the project team were added to the existing Miro board.

**Stakeholder interviews**

Research was conducted ‘as a team sport’ in that, where possible, everyone in the project team was involved in each session to reduce interviewer bias and limit the number of contacts with stakeholders.

Sessions were conducted in the form of in-depth interviews conducted via Skype calls. Over the course of the discovery, a total of 18 one hour interviews took place over a period of 6 days.

The raw insights were captured directly in Miro with user needs being pulled out and stored in an excel spreadsheet.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the team was unable to engage with the end users of PL, the practitioners. Education Scotland have some anecdotal insights from other research projects but _this is a gap that will need to be address in the next phase of the project._

**Desk research**

In addition to stakeholder interviews, the project team also reviewed key Education Scotland documents and outputs from other research activities, to learn more about Education Scotland’s strategy and objectives, how the organisation is structured, and understand the insight already available, so as not to ‘ask the same questions again’.

**Stakeholder workshops**

In both the current state analysis and future
state vision phases, the project team held stakeholder workshops via Skype and using Miro, to identify assumptions that should be challenged throughout the Discovery and to co-create solutions for current pain points.

**Gaps**

Due to stakeholder availability it is acknowledged that some gaps remain in the internal stakeholder research which should be addressed in the next phase. Further research is needed to fully understand how and when the following areas are incorporated into the journeys and processes:

- National Improvement Hub; in particular around curriculum information
- National Improvement Framework
- Scrutiny team
- Communications team

# 3. The current service (current state)

## Overview

The Professional Learning service covers the lifecycle of Professional Learning in all its varied formats, from computer-based training, guidance documents, face-to-face training, seminars, and so on.

The lifecycle includes:

- Identifying new or updated PL, which may be required
- Designing and creating or updating the PL
- Evaluating the PL before it is made available to practitioners
- Publishing the PL, so it is available to practitioners
- Event planning and management of live, in-person PL events
- Communicating and promoting PL
- Reviewing existing PL as a result of practitioner feedback and reflections, changes in policy and guidance, and scrutiny reports
