This report is the culmination of an eight week discovery conducted by the Digital Transformation Service on behalf of Education Scotland (ES).

Transformation of ES' Professional Learning lifecycle offers a significant opportunity to focus on the education practitioner's learning and development needs, and nurture closer relationships with them. In addition, it will improve the day-to-day experience of the staff responsible for delivering the Professional Learning service.

The Discovery project team has undertaken a user-centred, multi-disciplinary review to understand the current Professional Learning service.
The team has conducted an ‘as-is’ analysis to understand the current service, the needs of the users who provide and interact with the service and the technical landscape that supports and enables the service.

With stakeholders, the team co-designed and co-created a future vision of the Professional Learning service and identified opportunities to deliver transformational change.

Executive summary


Introduction

This report summarises our main findings, including:

- A review of the current state / as-is service, including a service journey blueprint, the core users, the technical architecture and the key pain points users experience
- A vision of the potential future state / to-be service, including improvement opportunities, enablers and technical architecture
- Design principles to guide future design and development, aligned to the Scottish Government’s Digital First Standards
- Recommendations for delivering:
  - An Alpha project, to begin delivering change, and the Alpha team required
  - A further Discovery project, to explore parts of the service this Discovery could not as not all users were available.

Due to the current pandemic, the project team had no access to education practitioners
(the teachers). As a result, the findings
and recommendations are mainly from the Education Scotland staff’s perspectives. Whilst the project team made full use of teacher insight gathered in previous user research activities, the education practitioners' needs must be validated in future phases of developing the Professional Learning service.
