## Challenge

The service needed to be as trustworthy and clear as GOV.UK itself, offering consistent, distraction-free guidance to users while adapting to the unique requirements of conversational interfaces.

</figure>

My brief was twofold:  

- **Backstage:** Figure out how to adapt backstage processes and technology to create a robust, scalable, and trustworthy chat experience.  
- **Frontstage:** Explore what it would mean from a front-end perspective _“if the GOV.UK website itself could chat with visitors”_ reflecting its clarity and reliability in a conversational format.

## Approach

I began by aligning cross-functional teams, including content designers, developers, and policy experts, to define the chatbot’s purpose and scope. Inspired by GOV.UK’s no-distractions service ethos, we focused on delivering precise, relevant responses to user queries while reducing “dead ends” in the chat flow.  

Key steps included:  

- **Starting with user needs:** Collaborating with researchers to understand common user pain points. Insights from user research shaped every design decision.  
- **Backstage innovation:** Simplifying integration with both HMRC and govuk's existing content management infrastructure to ensure chat responses remained accurate and up to date.  
- **Iterative design and testing:** Prototyping both the govuk-inspired IxD and the conversational flows and testing them with users to ensure clarity and utility.

</figure>

## Outcomes

- **24/7 assistance:** Delivered a chatbot capable of handling a significant volume of inquiries, reducing strain on helplines.  
- **Trust and satisfaction:** Users described the experience as clear and dependable, echoing GOV.UK’s tone of voice.  
- **Efficiency gains:** The chatbot saved HMRC an estimated £5 million in support costs and paved the way for further adoption of conversational UIs across government services.  

## Impact

The HMRC chatbot project demonstrated the value of combining human-centred design with robust backstage processes. By embedding GOV.UK’s design principles and values into a conversational experience, we were able to deliver immediate operational benefits.
