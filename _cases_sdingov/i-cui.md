title: HMRC Conversational user interface (CUI) service assessment

subtitle: >
  Demand for support from HMRC ebbs and flows with the movement of the financial year. The CUI assistant was designed to complement telephone and webchat support, helping customers self-serve by offering quick and queue-free answers to simple questions and providing much wanted 24-7 help with support during the pandemic.

## The challenge

Read Ruth Drake's great blog post on [designing helpful chatbots](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/06/14/6-tips-for-building-a-genuinely-helpful-chatbot/)


## Project outcomes

The use of virtual assistants in the online services for the Covid support programmes – including the furlough and the Self-Employment Income Support Schemes – helped many users find what they were looking for when they would otherwise have resorted to phoning an HMRC helpline. This delivered the department an estimated £5m in “cost-avoidance” savings.

Such success helped to accelerate the use of the technology, and the department has plans to expand the use of conversational UI to the HMRC app.
